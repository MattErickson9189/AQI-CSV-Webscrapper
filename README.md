This is the webscrapper I build to help collect the CSV files needed for me to
map the air quality index (AQI) for Minnesota for my GIS mapping
project. I originally was going to do the whole USA, but due to time constraints and missing data I am only doing Minnesota. This can easily be converted to do the whole USA

The biggest problem I have ran into is that depending on your internet connection selenium can have a lot of troubles genereating and downloading these files from the EPA's website. The other problem I ran into is that some states do not have data for certain years, especially in the 2000's so there are a lot of gaps.
