This is the webscrapper I build to help collect the CSV files needed for me to
map the air quality index (AQI) for each state in the USA for my GIS mapping
project.

The biggest problem I have ran into is that depending on your internet connection selenium can have a lot of troubles genereating and downloading these files from the EPA's website. The other problem I ran into is that some states do not have data for certain years, especially in the 2000's so there are a lot of gaps.
